# Bitcoin 101
After this section, you have a rough idea about the history of Bitcoin and it's major actors. You can assess the work of the miners and position it in the overall Ecosystem.
Here you learn "where the money is stored". Public-Private key cryptography is the foundation and transactions in the blockchain is how money get transfered from one to the other.

* Bitcoin timetable from cypherpunk to now
* economics (scarcity in one graph)
* Mining blocks, the race for a hash, mempool and transaction selection
* Blocks consists of transactions: A Ledger
* Understanding the difficulty adjustment and the halfening
* Adoption cycles through halvening events
* Scarcity in other shitcoins?
* Math does not need to be secure, money does!
* Q&A

* symmetric and asymmetric encryption
* Attestation as special case for asymetric encryption
* Imagine a crypto-bank: transactions-signing

* The anatomy of the blockchain: chained blocks consisting of transactions
* the anatomy of a transaction: we can only consume whole inputs, therefore change-addresses
* Example of a bitcoin-transaction
