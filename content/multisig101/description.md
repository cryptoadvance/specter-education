# Multisignature and it's challenges
At the end the of this section, the participants should have an idea about the challenges of multisig, different operational and deployment options and maybe have preferences in one or the other direction.
The final decision does not need to happen yet but after the pratical part.


## Backing up a multisignature

* Collecting Devices
* Creating the wallet
* The Specter-Backup-PDF
* More implications for Multisig

## Operational models
| time   | Form    | remarks |

| 1h     | L       |         |

* Dis-/Advantages of different quora
* Hardwarewallets and supply-chain attacks
* Fullnode vs. pruned-nodes
* passsphrases for multisig? Rather not.
* Operating specter-instances
    * specter/node in the cloud
    * specter/node on laptops (one or many)
    * specter/node on a node-appliance or server

## Reasonable quora, passphrases, practical Backup-management
| time   | Form    | remarks |
|--------|---------|---------|
| 1h     | L/D     |         |

* Which quorum is the correct one for this organisation?
* Which hardwarewallets should be used?
* How are the backups created and custodied?
* Where are specter-instances operated (Laptop/Server/Cloud)?
    * Fullnodes of pruned-nodes?

And the end of this section an idea for , one or more Quora should have been discussed and roughly placed to store devices and backups should be known.
