## About Formats
For trainings, it's quite important to specify the prerequisites the participants need to fullfill and also manage expectations of what they can expect.
The format of the respective unit gives a better understanding:

* Lecture (L): Slides consumption only. For some content, it might be beneficial if the participants can visit websites.
* Browser (B): The user needs to have access to a browser to do some small reading or a tiny exercise.
* Workshop-light (WL): The user needs a QR-code based hardware wallet and a laptop. The specter-instance/fullnode is hosted by cryptoadvance.
* Workshop-full (WF): The user needs a unix-based Laptop (Mac/Linux) in order to install software and a pruned node (10GB free diskpace necessary) 
* Discussion (D): The organisation needs to make decisions. Guided discussions.
* On site (ON): Needs physical presence.
