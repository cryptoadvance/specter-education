# specter-training

Let's make small composable parts and give them a reasonable content-description + a rough time estimate.

# Bitcoin 101
After this section, you have a rough idea about the history of Bitcoin and it's major actors. You can assess the work of the miners and position it in the overall Ecosystem.

## Bitcoin Fundamentals - History, Technical Components, Scarcity, Mining, Ledger


## Adoption, Shitcoins..

# Bitcoin transactions from a hodlers perspective

Here we you learn "where the money is stored". Public-Private key cryptography is the foundation and transactions in the blockchain is how money get transfered from one to the other.
Coming from the individual addresses, you'll learn about Hirarchical Deterministic Wallets and how it relates to the secret you have to finally protect: the seed.
We'll learn about different 

## Public-/Private key cryptography

## The ledger, transactions and understanding outputs/inputs

## From a single address to HD-Wallets, derivation pathes and address-types

## WHo knows what: recovering a Singlesig and leaking privacy
seed, passphrase, derivation-path (accounts)

# Multisignature and it's challenges (part 1)
At the end the of this section, the participants should have an idea about the challenges of multisig, different operational and deployment options and maybe have preferences in one or the other direction.
The final decision does not need to happen yet but after the pratical part.


## Backing up a multisignature

## Reasonable quora, passphrases?, practical Backup-management
And the end of this section, one or more Quora should have been discussed and roughly places to store devices and backups should be known.

# Full-Nodes and specter-instances

## presentiung different options 
* specter in the cloud
* specter on laptops (one or many)
* specter on a node-appliance or server

Different deployment-options: specterd vs. pip vs. electron-binaries

## Get into action - practical training

- Set up fresh laptops / server
- Download & setup pruned Bitcoin Core nodes
- Download & setup Specter Desktop
- HWWs setup - Update firmware - test transactions?

- Generate & Writedown Keys
- Add devices to Specter Desktop instances
- Create Multisig Wallet
- Send penny test to multisig wallet
- Backup Keys on Steelplates

- Delete/wipe Multisig & Device on Desktop
- Recover keys from steelplates
- Send pennytest from Multisig Wallet
- Repeat recovery process?

- Download Multisig-Backup-PDF, and put on USB & Paper
- Prepare Security-Tamper-Proof-Bags with Steelplates & Multisig backups.
- Additional copies of multisig backups to store where?
- Where to store the backups? BayernLB? Degussa safe desposit boxes?

# Questions
- What kind of computers? 
- How many instances of Specter? Hosted? Each user one instance?
- Which hardware wallets? Specter, Cobo...but Coldcard?
- Key generation? Dices? On device?
- Key tests - How to check if the keys still work?
- On a daily operational basis: Who keeps the HWWs with the private keys, and where?
