This repo contains training and educational material for Specter.

Trainings are composed out of smaller units which can be seen in the `content`-folder. An important duty of this repo is to compile and package that content into distrubutable units, html- and pdf-files.

The PDF-files are called `guides`. The definition is in the content.yaml file. Currently we only have one Guide: "default".

Build the html-pdf-files via `build.sh`.
